1) There are 25 horses. We have to find out the fastest 3 horses. In one race maximum 5 horses can run. How many such races are required in minimum to get the result?


a) 17


b) 20


c) 25


d) 15


answer : 7th race will be answer 


2) If all the 6 are replaced by 9, then the algebraic sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100(both inclusive) varies by
 
Answer :Sum of 100 numbers is 5050


And 3,13,23,43,53,63,73,83,93 replaced then by replacement of 9 numbers we get= 54 addition
and 30 to 39 except 33 all numbers get replaced by 60 so there is addition of =540
And  33 replaced by 99 so we get =66 additionally
So we get 5050+54+540+66= 5710
So variation will be 
5710-5050 
=660


3) What could be the maximum value of Q in the following equation?


5P9 + 3R7+ 2Q8 = 1114


a) 10


b) 12


c) 15


d) 9


Answer :option d)9
explanation: to get max value of Q we need that first two number must be minimum.For that we should put that value of P and R as minimum so we put P=0 and R=0
so by putting that values we get eq.
509+307+2Q8=1114
2Q8=1114-509-307
2Q8=298
so we get max value of Q as 9.
